Starting a few years ago, the term cloud took its place within the modern lexicon and became commonly used in everyday dialogue, even by lay persons with no connection to, training for, or expertise in the IT industry. It has become common in commercials targeting the public at large, and is often used as a main selling point for services and offerings. Even those who do not understand what cloud computing is, let alone how it works, have largely come to understand it as a positive feature, feeling that it means higher reliability, faster speed, and overall a more beneficial consumer experience. Also, many companies are flocking to the benefits and features of cloud computing at a rapid pace.

With this enormous paradigm shift in the industry, the need for skilled professionals who understand cloud computing has grown at a similarly rapid pace. This demand applies to professionals in all facets of computing, but the unique aspects and features of cloud computing make the need for skilled security personnel paramount to any organization in order to properly safeguard and protect their systems, applications, and data.

Cloud computing represents a new dynamic in how IT experts—and certainly IT security experts—look at protecting data and the various techniques and methodologies available to them. Some of you approaching this certification will be experienced security professionals and already hold other certifications such as the CISSP. For others, this certification may be your first as a security professional. Some of you have been working with cloud computing from its onset, while others will be learning the cloud basics for the first time. This volume of practice exams is designed to complement the CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional All-in-One Exam Guide and aims to aid anyone approaching this challenging exam, regardless of background or specific experience in security or general computing.

These practice exams, along with the CCSP Certified Cloud Security Professional All-in-One Exam Guide, will give you the information you need to pass the CCSP exam, as well as hopefully expand your understanding and knowledge beyond just being able to answer specific exam questions. My hope

is that you find both serve you long past the exam as comprehensive desktop references for the core concepts and approaches to cloud computing and cloud security.

The structure of the All-in-One Exam Guide is closely aligned with the subjects of the official exam guide from (ISC)2, and the practice exams are designed in the same manner.

Regardless of your background, experience, and other certifications, I hope you find the world of cloud computing and its unique security demands to be enlightening, challenging, and intellectually stimulating. Cloud represents a very dynamic and exciting new direction in computing, and one that seems likely to be a major paradigm for the foreseeable future.

**Why Get Certified**?

Obtaining an industry standard certification that is widely respected and recognized will serve the career of any IT professional. With cloud computing growing rapidly and more organizations clamoring to leverage its potential, the CCSP will serve as an independent verification of your skills and understanding of these concepts to any employer or regulatory agency. The CCSP can benefit anyone working in IT security at any level, from starting security analysts up to an organization’s chief information security officer (CISO). Although the CCSP will in many cases complement other security certifications, such as the CISSP, it can also serve as a first or standalone certification as well.

**How to Get Certified**

The following steps and requirements for the CCSP were valid at the time of writing, but as with anything in the IT industry and its rapidly changing landscape, you should always verify directly with (ISC)2 as to the most current requirements. The website for the CCSP can be found at isc site.

The following are the requirements to obtain the CCSP certification:

• Experience A candidate must have five years of fulltime IT work experience. Within this five years, they must have three years minimum experience in IT security, and at least one year minimum in at least one of the CCSP domains. If a candidate has the CCSK certificate from the CSA, it can be substituted for the CCSP domain experience requirement, and the

CISSP from (ISC)2 can be used solely to fulfill the entire experience requirement for the CCSP.

Exam The candidate must register for and pass the C**CSP certification** exam. Information about registration and the fees required can be found on the CCSP website listed earlier. The exam is four hours in duration, with 125 questions. A candidate must successfully pass the exam with a scaled score of 700 out of 1000 points.

Endorsement Upon meeting the experience requirements and successfully passing the exam, a candidate must have their application endorsed by a current (ISC)2 certification holder. This endorsement must be done by someone who knows the candidate and can attest to the validity of their experience and professional credentials.

Maintenance After being awarded the b, a certification holder must complete specific continuing professional education (CPE) requirements and pay annual maintenance fees (AMFs). Refer to the official (ISC)2 site for current information about both requirements.
